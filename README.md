## Description

This class teaches you how to build an Ethereum Smart Contract. This project implements a game of Liar's Dice where a crypto wallet is used for authentication and a smart contract is used to maintain the bank. Once a player is authenticated, they bet money for each game played and that money comes from their crypto wallet. The class is a mix of lecture and coding. During the class you will learn the different aspects of smart contract technology and pair program with the instructor as you build this code base from scratch.

## Our Experience

We have taught Go to thousands of developers all around the world since 2014. There is no other company that has been doing it longer and our material has proven to help jump-start developers 6 to 12 months ahead of their knowledge of Go. We know what knowledge developers need in order to be productive and efficient when writing software in Go.

Our classes are perfect for intermediate-level developers who have at least a few months to years of experience writing code in Go. Our classes provide a very deep knowledge of the programming langauge with a big push on language mechanics, design philosophies and guidelines. We focus on teaching how to write code with a priority on consistency, integrity, readability and simplicity. We cover a lot about “if performance matters” with a focus on mechanical sympathy, data oriented design, decoupling and writing/debugging production software.

## Minimal Qualified Student

The material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class. Students with the following minimal background will get the most out of the class.

* Studied CS in school or has a minimum of two years of experience programming full time professionally.
* Familiar with structural and object oriented programming styles.
* Has worked with arrays, lists, queues and stacks.
* Understands processes, threads and synchronization at a high level.
* Operating Systems
	* Has worked with a command shell.
	* Knows how to maneuver around the file system.
	* Understands what environment variables are.

## Before You Come To Class

The following is a set of tasks that can be done prior to showing up for class.  We will also do this in class if anyone has not completed it.  However, the more attendees that complete this ahead of time the more time we have to cover additional training material.

### Prep Work

**You will get the most out of this class if you have taken the Ultimate Go bundle of classes first.**

[Ultimate Go Classes](https://www.ardanlabs.com/ultimate-go)  
[Scholarship](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchEz6zg1fseR2XiIZgNB8Qm2a5JDB7n3EOWX5GeIP18OstaQ/viewform)  

This is a free and great class to learning concepts behind blockchains. Watch videos 1, 2, 6 and 8 for sure.  
[Blockchain Class](https://cryptocurrencyclass.github.io/) - Patrick McCorry  

### Joining the Go Slack Community

We use a Slack channel to share links, code, and examples during the training. This is free. This is also the same Slack community you will use after training to ask for help and interact with may Go experts around the world in the community.

1. Using the following link, fill out your name and email address: https://invite.slack.gobridge.org
1. Check your email, and follow the link to the slack application.
1. Join the training channel by clicking on this link: https://gophers.slack.com/messages/training/
1. Click the “Join Channel” button at the bottom of the screen.

### Installing the Training Material

While many of the examples can be done using the online playground (http://play.golang.org), some may find it easier to complete them with their local editor. To do so, you will want to load the training material locally to your machine. From a command prompt, issue the following commands:

```
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir code
$ cd code
$ git clone https://github.com/ardanlabs/liarsdice
$ cd liarsdice
```
